# BGMP JS Exercise
 
- Create a basic single page web app that pulls and displays data from the NASA Mars Rover Photos API. The page should contain a form at the top and a results list underneath. The form should enable a user to query the api with data and camera parameters. Results should display as a list of thumbnail images along with the full name of the camera. The thumbnail should link through to the full sized image. The results list should update as the form is modified. If no results are found, a message should be presented to the user.
 
## Bonus Points
- Display the full size image in a modal.
- Add a button that clears the form and the results.
 
## Restrictions
- jQuery is the only allowed library/framework.
